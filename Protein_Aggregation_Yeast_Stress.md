This protocol is for harvesting of yeast and separation of their
proteins into aggregate/membrane and soluble fractions, for further
analysis by SDS-PAGE, western blot, mass spectrometry, etc. Based on
Mike Dion and Allan Drummond’s 2011 protocols, with extensive
modifications by Edward Wallace with help from Quincey Justman.

Prepare {#prepare .unnumbered}
-------

-   soluble protein buffer stock (SPBS; 20mM HEPES-KOH pH7.4, 120mM KCl, 2mM
    EDTA).

-   soluble protein buffer (SPB; SPBS + 0.2mM DTT, 
    1:100 PMSF, 1:100 protease inhibitors cocktail IV).
    Add DTT and inhibitors shortly before use, and chill.

-   total protein buffer (TPB; 20mM HEPES-NaOH pH7.4, 150mM NaCl, 5mM
    EDTA, 3% SDS, 1:100 PMSF, 2mM DTT, 1:1000 protease inhibitors IV).
    Again, make stock solution, add DTT and inhibitors shortly before use.

-   insoluble protein buffer (IPB; 8M Urea, 20mM HEPES-NaOH pH7.4, 150mM
    NaCl, 2% SDS, 2mM EDTA, 2mM DTT, 1:100 PMSF, 1:1000 protease
    inhibitors IV.). Mix fresh daily the urea, DTT, and inhibitors, and
    keep at room temperature:

      2<span>$\mu$L</span>& 13<span>$\mu$L</span>& protease inhibitors\

    Use 500<span>$\mu$L</span>IPB per sample, and note that Urea is slow
    to dissolve, and foaming will make $\sim$25% of the
    solution unusable. IPB solidifies at 4due to urea and SDS; also,
    don’t substitute KCl as it precipitates SDS even at RT.

-   For heat treatment, pre-warm water bath to 46or pre-warm media
    as required.

-   Appropriate numbers of safe-lok tubes loaded with 7mm steel balls,
    racked in liquid nitrogen (LN2).

-   Pre-chill a centrifuge, also label and lay out all tubes and
    equipment in advance as the protocol moves very quickly
    once started.

-   Protocol can be paused and samples stored at -80when cells have been
    flash-frozen (step \[step:flashfreeze\]), and after cells have been
    ground in mixer mill (step \[step:powder\]).

Sample Growth {#sample-growth .unnumbered}
-------------

1.  For each strain, inoculate a 3 mL pre-culture of SC-complete medium
    with a single yeast colony and incubate overnight at 30with shaking
    or rotation.

2.  Inoculate overnight culture to $OD_{600} \approx 0.01$ in
    SC-complete medium in a baffled flask, grow to $4 \times 10^6$
    cells/mL ($OD_{600} \approx 0.45$) at 30with 200rpm shaking.

Sample Harvesting and Lysis {#sample-harvesting-and-lysis .unnumbered}
---------------------------

1.  Transfer $2 \times 10^8$ cells to a 50mL conical tube (50 mL of a
    $4 \times 10^6$ cells/mL culture).

2.  Spin at 4000g for 30s in a swinging bucket rotor at RT. The end of
    this spin marks the start of the timed treatment duration. Gently
    decant and discard supernatant. For heat shock treatment, hold tube
    containing pellet in waterbath at desired temperature for desired
    time; alternatively, transfer to pre-warmed media for desired time
    and end by spinning as described.

3.  Resuspend pellet in 1ml ice-cold SPBS (no inhibitors needed), on ice, 
    and transfer to 1.5ml tube.

4.  Spin at 5,000g, 4C, for 30 seconds.

5.  Resuspend new pellet in 150<span>$\mu$L</span> SPB.

6.  \[step:flashfreeze\] Drip 100uL of resuspended pellet onto upper
    wall of tube containing steel ball, still racked in LN2. Goal is to
    get a nugget of frozen material on the wall, and to avoid dripping
    the material around the ball and thus freezing the ball to the
    bottom of the tube; having some LN2 remaining in the tube helps.
    Place the remaining 100uL of resuspended pellet in a tube for total
    protein extraction: process, or freeze, immediately.

7.  Place tubes at -80; when all LN2 has boiled out of tube (listen – if
    any popping or hissing, keep waiting), snap tube closed carefully,
    away from other tubes. Keep in LN2. (Any remaining LN2 in tube will
    cause tube to explode open and fire the stainless steel ball into
    your iPad, brain, colleague, or other important equipment.)

8.  Rack the tube into the PTFE 2mL tube adaptor for the Retsch Mixer
    Mill MM400 (Retsch \#22.008.0005) and submerge the entire assembly
    in LN2. Agitate for $4\times 90$ seconds at 30 Hz in a Retsch Mixer
    Mill MM400, returning sample holder to LN2 between sessions.
    Complete lysis produces fine snowy powder in the tube.

9.  \[step:powder\] Remove sample tubes from LN2, tap on bench to
    release powder from lid, and pop the caps to relieve pressure.

10. Add 400 <span>$\mu$L</span>SPB to each tube, thaw on ice with
    occasional vortexing, and as soon as possible extract ball with
    a magnet. (We rinse balls in methanol and store in 50% ethanol.)

Soluble fraction extraction {#soluble-fraction-extraction .unnumbered}
---------------------------

1.  Spin at 3000g for 30 seconds (clarification step) to remove whole
    cells and very large aggregates.

2.  Decant clarified liquid into a 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube. If
    troubleshooting, keep the pellet and process it alongside the
    insoluble fraction; this end product is the *unclarified fraction*.

3.  Spin at 100,000g for 20 minutes (fixed-angle TLA-55 rotor at 40,309
    rpm, 4, in a Beckman Coulter Optimax tabletop ultracentrifuge).

4.  Decant supernatant into a 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube: this is the
    *soluble fraction*.

5.  Take 10ul aliquot of soluble fraction and mix with 2X Laemmli
    buffer; use this to run a protein gel and assess protein integrity.

Insoluble fraction extraction {#insoluble-fraction-extraction .unnumbered}
-----------------------------

1.  Violently snap pellet to clear remaining liquid.

2.  Add 500 <span>$\mu$L</span>soluble protein buffer (SPB) and vortex.
    (The pellet may not resuspend; that’s fine.)

3.  Spin at 100,000g for 20 minutes.

4.  Discard supernatant, clear residual liquid with a hard snap.

5.  Add 250 <span>$\mu$L</span>insoluble protein buffer (IPB); note this
    means insoluble sample is relatively 2X concentrated to others.
    Process samples in IPB at room temperature to maintain solubility of
    the Urea.

6.  Dislodge the pellet with a pipet tip, Vortex until pellet dissolves,
    10-15 minutes for clarified samples.

7.  Spin at 20,000g, RT, for 5 minutes.

8.  Decant supernatant into a 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube: this is the
    *insoluble fraction*.

9.  Run a 4-15% SDS-page gel; load roughly 5-10<span>$\mu$L</span>of
    total and soluble fractions and 2-4 times the quantity of
    insoluble fractions. Make aliquots for further analysis.

Total protein extraction {#total-protein-extraction .unnumbered}
------------------------

1.  Add 400 <span>$\mu$L</span>TPB to each total protein tube. Incubate
    at 95°C with 500rpm mixing for 20 min.

2.  Vortex vigorously for 15 min.

3.  Spin at 6000g, RT, 1 min. Take supernatant; this is the *total
    protein fraction*.

Chloroform:Methanol Extraction {#chloroformmethanol-extraction .unnumbered}
------------------------------

For Mass Spectrometry runs, or shipping proteins at room temperature,
first perform a precipitation. Detergents, like SDS, and salts, like
NaCl, can disrupt LC-MS/MS runs. Precipitation with chloroform and
methanol results in dry protein material, free of salt and detergent.

141–143.

1.  To 100<span>$\mu$L</span>protein sample
    ( 100<span>$\mu$g</span>protein) in a 1.5mL tube:

2.  Add 400<span>$\mu$L</span>methanol and vortex thoroughly.

3.  Add 100<span>$\mu$L</span>chloroform and vortex.

4.  Add 300<span>$\mu$L</span>H2O—mixture will become cloudy with
    precipitate—and vortex.

5.  Centrifuge 1 minute at 14,000g. Result is three layers: a large
    aqueous layer on top, a circular flake of protein in the interphase,
    and a smaller chloroform layer at the bottom.

6.  Remove top aqueous layer carefully, trying not to disturb the
    protein flake.

7.  Add 400<span>$\mu$L</span>methanol and vortex.

8.  Centrifuge 5 minutes at 20,000g, which will slam dandruffy
    precipitate against the tube wall.

9.  Remove as much methanol as possible. Be careful, because the pellet
    is delicate. You should be able to remove all but a few
    <span>$\mu$L</span>of methanol with care, which will speed drying.

10. Dry under vacuum, and seal tube. This may be stored at RT short-term
    or -20long term, prior to resuspension.
